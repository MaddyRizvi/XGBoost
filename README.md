# XGBoost Classification Project

This project demonstrates how to use **XGBoost**, an optimized gradient boosting framework, to solve a classification problem using Python and scikit-learn. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook (`xg_boost.ipynb`), and it includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and cross-validation. This project can be applied to any other big dataset to obtain the efficient result.

## 📁 Files

- `xg_boost.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing code for:
  - Data loading
  - Preprocessing
  - Model training using `XGBClassifier`
  - Model evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy)
  - k-Fold Cross Validation
- `Data.csv` – Dataset used in the notebook (must be placed in the same directory)

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure to install the required libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
```

Or install from requirements.txt (if available):


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Project Overview

### Steps Covered:

1. **Data Import**  
   Load the dataset (`Data.csv`) using `pandas`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Splits the dataset into features (`X`) and labels (`y`), and then into training and test sets.

3. **Model Training**  
   Trains an XGBoost classifier using the training data.

4. **Prediction and Evaluation**  
   Predicts labels on the test set and evaluates performance using:
   - Confusion matrix
   - Accuracy score

5. **Cross-Validation**  
   Applies 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate model stability and generalization.

## 📈 Output Example

After training and evaluation, the notebook prints:
- Confusion matrix
- Accuracy of the test set
- Mean accuracy and standard deviation from k-fold cross-validation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Make sure `Data.csv` is available in the same directory.
3. Open the notebook with Jupyter or Google Colab.
4. Run the cells step by step to train and evaluate the model.
